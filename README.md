# Social Media Privacy-Preserving Data Processing Framework

Repo contains the implementation of a privacy-preserving data processing framework designed for social media text analytics. The framework leverages advanced techniques in differential privacy, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and federated learning to ensure that user data remains confidential while enabling insightful analysis. The project also includes empirical investigations into the impact of large language models (LLMs) on privacy and introduces a privacy-by-translation mechanism to further safeguard sensitive information.

## Business Requirement

With the increasing reliance on social media data for sentiment analysis, customer feedback, and trend analysis, companies face the challenge of extracting valuable insights while maintaining user privacy. Regulatory requirements, such as GDPR, demand that user data is handled with the utmost care, particularly when dealing with personally identifiable information (PII). The business need is to develop a robust framework that allows companies to process social media data without compromising user privacy, enabling compliance with privacy regulations while still benefiting from data-driven insights.

## Problem Statement

Social media platforms generate vast amounts of data that can be invaluable for businesses, yet they pose significant privacy risks. Traditional data processing methods may expose sensitive user information, making it vulnerable to misuse. The challenge is to design a system that can process social media text data for analysis while preserving the privacy of individual users. This includes anonymizing data, securing it during processing, and ensuring that any insights derived from the data do not inadvertently reveal personal information.

## Solution Overview

To address these challenges, the project implements a privacy-preserving data processing framework with the following key components:

1. **Data Collection with Anonymization**:
   - Data is collected from social media platforms with techniques to anonymize personally identifiable information (PII) at the source, ensuring that raw data does not expose sensitive details.

2. **Differential Privacy for Data Annotation**:
   - A differential privacy mechanism is integrated into the data annotation process, adding noise to the data to prevent the identification of individuals, even when aggregated data is analyzed.

3. **Privacy-by-Translation Mechanism**:
   - This novel approach uses a translation mechanism that converts sensitive data into a less identifiable form before processing. This method ensures that the processed data retains its utility for analysis while minimizing privacy risks.

4. **Federated Learning for Model Training**:
   - Federated learning is employed to train machine learning models on decentralized data sources without requiring raw data to be centralized. This method allows models to learn from data across different nodes while keeping the data localized, reducing the risk of data breaches.

5. **Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Processing**:
   - Homomorphic encryption is applied to enable computations on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first, ensuring that data remains secure throughout the processing pipeline.

6. **Comprehensive Privacy Evaluation**:
   - The framework includes a rigorous privacy evaluation process using adversarial and unsupervised learning models. This ensures that the implemented privacy mechanisms are effective against potential threats and that the models' outputs do not compromise user privacy.

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Privacy Preservation**: From data collection to model deployment, privacy is maintained throughout the entire lifecycle.
- **Scalable Solution**: The framework is designed to handle large-scale social media data while ensuring compliance with privacy standards.
- **Advanced Privacy Techniques**: Utilizes state-of-the-art privacy-preserving technologies, including differential privacy, homomorphic encryption, and federated learning.
- **Empirical Investigations**: Includes comprehensive studies on the impact of large language models (LLMs) on user privacy.
